# Lead Planning Salesforce Metadata Package

## Overview

[Lead Management Process Overview.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/999cbebf-fcc1-44bf-90a6-233bea986659)


This package provides customizations and automation for Salesforce Lead management, an activity management innovation that emphasizes internal motivation - checking off boxes, crossing off your to-do list, activites like that. Lead management is focused on planning and tracking next steps. It includes custom fields, a flow for automating task creation, a list view, and a permission set for user access.

## Contents

- **objects/Lead.object**  
  Customizations to the Lead object, including custom fields for activity tracking, action overrides, and list/search layouts.

- **flows/Lead_On_Update_Lead_Planning.flow**  
  An auto-launched flow that automates the creation of Task records and manages Lead fields when certain updates occur.

- **permissionsets/Lead_Planning.permissionset**  
  A permission set granting access to the custom Lead fields and object-level permissions.

- **package.xml**  
  Salesforce package manifest for deployment.

## Custom Fields on Lead

- **Activity_Type__c** (Picklist):  
  Tracks the type of activity (Call, Meeting, Email, Text, Drop-In, Other).

- **Completed_Step_Notes__c** (TextArea):  
  Notes about the completed step.

- **Next_Step_Date__c** (Date):  
  The date for the next planned step.

- **Next_Step_Days_From_Now__c** (Number, Formula):  
  Calculates the number of days from today to the next step date.

- **Next_Step__c** (Text):  
  Description of the next step.

## Automation: Lead_On_Update_Lead_Planning Flow

- **Trigger:**  
  Runs after a Lead record is updated, specifically when `Completed_Step_Notes__c` is not null and has changed.

- **Logic:**  
  - Creates a Task record with details from the Lead (description, status, subject, whoId, activity date).
  - After creating the Task, it nulls out the Lead's activity fields (`Activity_Type__c`, `Completed_Step_Notes__c`, `Next_Step_Date__c`, `Next_Step__c`).

- **Purpose:**  
  Ensures that completed steps are logged as Tasks and that the Lead is ready for the next planning cycle.

## Permissions: Lead_Planning Permission Set

- Grants read/edit access to custom Lead fields (except `Next_Step_Days_From_Now__c`, which is read-only).
- Allows create, read, and edit access to the Lead object (no delete).
- Makes the Lead tab visible.

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Retrieve or deploy using Salesforce CLI:**
   ```sh
   sfdx force:mdapi:deploy -d . -u <target-org>
   ```
   Or use Workbench/Change Sets as appropriate.
 

- Users with the "Lead Planning" permission set can view and update the custom Lead fields.
- When a user completes a step and enters notes, a Task is automatically created and the Lead's planning fields are reset for the next cycle.
- The custom list view "My Leads - Next 7 Days" helps users focus on upcoming follow-ups.
